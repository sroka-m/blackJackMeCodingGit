#Description

This project was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYCWccL-3U from https://github.com/ImKennyYip/black-jack
Kenny Yip code is light and elegant but contains a small bug(dealer draws the cards and the sum is not reduced by the presence of aces. This leads to dealer sum sometimes being below 17. Also in this project i give 2 cards to both player and dealer, then player draws cards, then player eventually will stnad and then dealer draws. This how it works in casinos. Moreover giving all cards to the dealer means that sometiems player sees if the dealer has a bust (it's like "fake winning").
